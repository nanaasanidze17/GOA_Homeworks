<h2 style="color: navy;">C++</h2>

<h3 style="color: navy; background-color: rgb(216, 203, 187);">C++ (pronounced "see plus plus") is a computer programming language based on  It was created for writing programs for many different purposes.<br> In the 1990s, C++ became one of the most used programming languages in the world <br>
 Like C, C++ uses manual memory management (unlike most mainstream languages, where memory management is automatic), while the syntax usually used for it is different. The C++ programming language was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in the 1980s, and was originally named "C with classes". <br>
 The language was planned as an improvement on the C programming language, adding features based on object-oriented programming.</h3>

<h2 style="color: navy;">Python</h2>

<h3 style="color:navy; background-color: rgb(216, 203, 187);">Python is a programming language. It was made to be open source and easy to read. A Dutch programmer named Guido van Rossum made Python in 1991. He named it after the television program Monty Python's Flying Circus. Many Python examples and tutorials include jokes from the show.[31]

    Python is an interpreted language. Interpreted languages do not need to be compiled to run. <br>
     A program called an interpreter runs Python code on almost any kind of computer. <br>
     This means that a programmer can change the code and quickly see the results. 
    This also means Python is slower than a compiled language like C, because it is not turned into machine code ahead of time. <br>
     Instead, this happens as the program is running.</h3>


  <p style="color:aliceblue" id="CSS">CSS</p>

<h2 style="color: navy;">CSS</h2>

<h3 style="color:navy; background-color: rgb(216, 203, 187);">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML . <br> CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. <br>

    CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. <br>
    This separation can improve content accessibility;[further explanation needed] provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</h3>
