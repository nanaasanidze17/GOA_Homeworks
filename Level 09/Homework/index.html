<h3><i>1. Python</i></h3>
<p> <b>Python is a programming language.</b> It was made to be open source and easy to read. A Dutch programmer named <strong> van Rossum </strong> made Python in 1991. <br> 
  Python is an interpreted language. Interpreted languages do not need to be compiled to run. A program called an interpreter runs Python code on almost any kind of computer. </p>
